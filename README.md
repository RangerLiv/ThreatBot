ThreatBot: Threat Watch Console
My First Cybersecurity GUI Project

Project Overview
This is my very first coding project, built to learn, grow, and explore the world of cybersecurity, threat detection, and GUI programming. It started as a random idea that I wanted to flesh out; make a simple program that could call my own and also show the work I'm putting in to improve myself and make myself a more attractive candidate for employment. What was supposed to be a quick thing blew up into this and I can't be more proud of my first dive into coding.

ThreatBot simulates and visualizes threat alerts on a map, mimicking how major cyber events show up on SOC dashboards. I had to add the StarTrek sounds because why not?

This is only the beginning and I can't wait to build on this more as I go.

Key Features
Simulated Threat Feed: Threats appear randomly with different severity levels.

Map Visualization: Shows attack locations with interactive markers.

Alert Log + CVE Lookup: All alerts are logged and can be cross-referenced with CVE data.

Sound + Theme Toggle: Audio feedback and dark/light mode support. The console does flash a bright red quickly.

Live Feed Controller: Pause or resume the sim at anytime.

Built With
Python 3.13

customtkinter – for a modern UI experience

tkintermapview – for map display and interaction

Pygame – for sound playback

PIL (Pillow) – for image handling

Why I Made This
I come from a background far outside tech; I've spent the last 20+ years as an EMT, then Paramedic as well as Firefighter, so this project is that first tangible thing I can use to show I'm serious about moving into this new career.

What's Next
Connecting to live CVE feeds

Logging threats to a database

Adding user settings and history viewer

Publishing as an educational tool
